## Project description

stt-split-audio helps you feed audio segments to stt.pecha.tools for annotation.


## Who this project is for
This project is intended for STT training data manager who wants to supply audio segments for annotation.


## Project dependencies
Before using stt-split-audio, ensure you have:
* Access to the catalog spread sheets.
* HuggingFace account and token.
* AWS credentials (aws_access_key_id, aws_secret_access_key) that has access to upload new segments to the monlam.ai.stt bucket
* Google Cloud account with access to the audio files in the catalog.


## Instructions for use
Get started with stt-split-audio by checking the catalog for a department and checking what id range to upload to the stt.pecha.tools.


### Install stt-split-audio
1. Get the Google Cloud Client secret to download files from Google Drive 

    Login to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and create a project.
   Click "API and services" > "Credentials" > "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs" > Download "Client secret" and rename it to credentials.json
   Upload the credentials.json file to **util** folder in **stt-split-audio**
    
    _(Optional: Include a code sample or screenshot that helps your users complete this step.)_

2. Install ffmpeg on EC2 if you are using EC2 Amazon Linux
    Use [this](https://www.maskaravivek.com/post/how-to-install-ffmpeg-on-ec2-running-amazon-linux/) link to install ffmpeg
    After following the steps from the above link also run 
    > ln -s /usr/local/bin/ffmpeg/ffprobe /usr/bin/ffprobe

3. Login to aws cli with 
    > aws configure

4. Database credentials 
    Create an .env file in util with the following environment variables 
    - HOST
    - DBNAME
    - DBUSER
    - PASSWORD

5. Ways to run the script. 
  Sample Commands for Individual Steps(for example youtube link download from new catalog):

    - first step cd to util directory: cd util 
    
    - Download YouTube videos and split into audio:

      bash code:
      ```
      python ../audio_download_and_split/yt_download.py --config ../json_config/nw_config.json
      ```
    - Run inference on audio segments:

      bash code:
      ```
      python ../inference_runner/run_inference.py --config ../json_config/nw_config.json
      ```
    - Generate CSV from inference results:

      bash code:
      ```
      python ../make_db_csv/make_csv.py --config ../json_config/nw_config.json
      ```
  How to Run the Entire Flow(for example youtube link download from new catalog):
    To run all the steps in one go, use your run_all.sh script, which executes each of the three key Python scripts (yt_download.py, run_inference.py, make_csv.py) sequentially. The script checks for errors after each step and stops if an error is encountered.

    Ensure your environment is set up:

      Google Cloud credentials are in place.
      Required Python libraries are installed.
      AWS CLI is configured and authenticated.
      go to util directory: cd util/
      Run the shell script: ../run_all.sh

  AB audiobook extra step (etext transfer):
    After make_csv.py, the AB pipeline runs download_doc.py with ab_config_etext.json.
    That script downloads Google Doc etexts into ETEXTS_DIR (default ../data/etexts/),
    transfers annotations onto the predicted CSV, and writes:
      - ../data/stt_ab_upload_new.csv
      - ../data/stt_ab_analysis.csv
    Do not use make_db_csv/transfer_text.py for AB; it is a legacy path and is not part of run_all.sh.

## Transfer Text Function
### Overview
The transfer_text function aligns and transfers annotations from predicted text (in a TSV file) to the original text (in a text file). The output is a DataFrame containing transferred annotations, ensuring a one-to-one correspondence between the predicted and original text.

For the AB workflow, this transfer is performed inside `make_db_csv/download_doc.py` (not `transfer_text.py`). Etext files are read from `ETEXTS_DIR` in `json_config/ab_config_etext.json` (default `../data/etexts/`).
